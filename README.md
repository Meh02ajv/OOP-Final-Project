​📌 Project Overview
​This project is a Java-based application focused on raising awareness about the environmental cost of food consumption. By leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, the application allows users to build a virtual "Meal" and instantly see its aggregated environmental impact, specifically in terms of carbon footprint and water usage.
​The final application will use image recognition (or simulated values based on image input) to estimate the food items added to a meal, providing a modern, intuitive user interface.


​✨ Key Features
​OOP Modeling: Utilizes classes like FoodItem, MeatItem (e.g., Beef), PlantItem (e.g., Lentils), and Meal to demonstrate encapsulation and aggregation.
​Impact Tracking: Calculates the total environmental burden of a meal by summing the carbonFootprintPerKg and waterUsage of all included FoodItem instances.
​Encapsulation: All FoodItem properties (like carbonFootprintPerKg and waterUsage) are protected via private fields and public accessors/mutators.
​Aggregation: The Meal class aggregates multiple FoodItem objects, demonstrating a "has-a" relationship.
​Image Recognition Input (Future): Planned integration to use an image input to estimate the food item and quantity, feeding data into the core Java model.
