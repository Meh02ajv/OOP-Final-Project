​📌 Project Overview

Our project focuses on estimating the environmental impact of meals, especially West African meals, based on the food items the user builds to form a meal. This system is a web-based architecture that allows a user to take a picture of their meal, and the system we built identifies the food items and proportions using a recognition module. After identifying the food items, the system calculates the food items' impact using environmental metrics such as carbon footprint per kilogram, water usage, and land usage. Then it combines the individual food items' contributions to calculate the total impact of the meal. The user can also compare the impact of different food choices and make a decision on which food to consume. 

​✨ Key Features

•	GUI (Frontend): what is displayed for the users

•	Backend API: what connects the frontend(GUI) with the backend (Java logic). 

•	Image Recognition Module (Gemini Generative API): external service used to identify food items in the image. 

•	Database: where the data about the food items is stored. 

​🛠️ Technology Stack 

- Language: Java (The core language for building the OOP model and logic).
- HTML: to build the structure of the webpage.
- CSS: to desgin and enhance the webpage's appearance.
- PHP: to handle the backend contents
- GitHub: for collaboration and code management
